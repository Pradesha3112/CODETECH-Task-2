Overview of the Project

Project Title: SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Objectives:
1.To create a user-friendly calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
2.To implement a menu-driven program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3.To ensure the program handles user inputs effectively and provides appropriate feedback.

Key Features/Activities:
1.User Input:
  Accepts two numbers (Num1 and Num2) from the user for computation.
  Provides a menu-driven interface to choose operations.
  
2.Arithmetic Operations:
  Addition: Adds two numbers and displays the result.
  Subtraction: Computes the difference, ensuring no negative results.
  Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers.
  Division: Performs integer division, with checks to avoid division by zero.

3.Exit Option:
`Provides an option to exit the program gracefully.

Technologies Used:
  Programming Language: Python.

Key Insights:
1.Input Validation:
  Ensures valid user input through conditional checks for division by zero and invalid menu options.

2.Iterative Design:
  Uses a while loop for continuous interaction until the user decides to exit.

3.Error Handling:
  Includes checks to handle edge cases like zero inputs for division or invalid menu choices.

Future Enhancements:
1.Floating-Point Support:
  Extend the calculator to handle decimal numbers for precise calculations.

2.Additional Operations:
  Include advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation, or square root.

3.Error Messages:
  Improve feedback with detailed error messages for invalid inputs or zero-division attempts.

4.GUI Integration:
  Develop a graphical user interface using tools like Tkinter or PyQt for a better user experience.

5.Result History:
  Add a feature to maintain a history of operations performed during the session.

Challenges Faced:
1.Implementing intuitive input validation to guide the user.
2.Handling unexpected user inputs without breaking the program.

Learning Outcomes:
1.Strengthened understanding of control flow (loops, conditionals).
2.Learned how to manage user input and create a menu-driven interface.
3.Developed an understanding of edge-case handling and basic arithmetic operations in Python.
